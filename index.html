        <p> Web design and development is an umbrella term that describes the process of creating a website. Like the name suggests, it involves two major skill sets: web design and web development. Web design determines the look and feel of a website, while web development determines how it functions. </p>
      
      
        <p>A web designer's job is to build the visual appeal for a website. Meanwhile, a web developer writes code and builds the back-end functionality. It's important to understand the difference between these two roles so you can find the right person for your projects. </p>
      
        <p>Web design involves creating the visual layout and aesthetics of a website, focusing on user experience, graphics, and overall look. Front-end development, on the other hand, involves implementing the design into a functional website using coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
